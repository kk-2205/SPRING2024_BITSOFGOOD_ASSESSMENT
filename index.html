            <p class="intro">Hi, I am Karishma. I am a 2nd-year CS major. I am from India but have lived in Dubai all my life.</p>
            <p class="passion">I am passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on society. Last year, I actively volunteered with Hindu YUVA, organizing socio-cultural activities and community outreach events like sandwich-making and blood drives. This experience reinforced my commitment to creating meaningful change through both my technical skills and community involvement.</p>
