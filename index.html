            <p class="intro">Hi, I am Karishma. I am a 2nd-year CS major. I am from India but have lived in Dubai all my life.</p>
            <p class="passion">I find immense joy in aiding projects related to education for children, leading environmental and sustainable efforts, so making a positive difference truly motivates and inspires me. My experiences with such efforts in the past have highlighted how meaningful and impactful our efforts can be. Iâ€™m excited to bring this passion to Bits of Good and continue making a meaningful impact!</p>
